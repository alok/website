    <h2>General</h2>

    <h2>Humble Beginnings</h2>
    <p>Nikkei Choral Ensemble was founded in 2010 by Naomi Amakawa originally as an open student musical group, no audition required, within the Nikkei Student Union (NSU). The group, without an official name, served as more of a social music group rather than a performing arts group and only occasionally performed at cultural events. </p>
    <p>From Fall 2011-Spring 2016, Nikkei Choral Ensemble operated as an autonomous group with the NSU. Holding their first showcase in Spring 2012, members of NiCE began to focus on performance as a key component of group activity. The group began auditioning new members within the same semester.</p>
    <p>In Fall 2016, Nikkei Choral Ensemble became an independent RSO musical group. </p>
